These fixtures were taken from
<https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/d76092b2ddd86ecaa9df2a23610fd86a34ed379b/packages/babel-core/test/fixtures/config>.

Note that this module does not currently walk the file system in search for
`.babelrc` file, so the `dir1` fixture has not been included.

Similarly this module does not currently respect `.babelignore` files, and
consequently `.babelignore` files have not been included.
